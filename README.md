# Cub3D
This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever.

<pre>
This project’s objectives are similar to all this first year’s objectives: Rigor, use of C, use
of basic algorithms, information research etc.
As a graphic design project, cub3D will enable you to improve your skills in these
areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.
To conclude cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics without having to understand the specifics.
With the help of the numerous documents available on the internet, you will use
mathematics as a tool to create elegant and efficient algorithms.
